脑洞英语

BrainHole idea list[脑洞清单](http://blog.zhimind.com/NaoDong-list.html) 里的英语部分

In short:

1. recite words using mnemotechny
2. practice in the way of which Benjamin Franklin wrote in his autobiography

Now only a part of functions of reciting words

## Technic

1. Jquery + IndexedDB -- the code is in a very bad form of organization mixing Jquery with pure Javascript.
2. Python Flask + ProgreSQL on Openshift. But it seems to be too slow. Waiting (TTFB) is too long. Maybe I will transit to Google app engine. However my main website is still planned to stay on Openshift. Therefore, it will be a severe issue on user informations.

## 待实现事项优先级

1. write the mnemotechny contexts for words.

## 待实现功能

- a better random reciting mode
- better UI
- practice part. So I need some open corpora?
- extract the sentences to match words according to the difficulty or test type. CET4/6, Ielts, TOELF, GRE
- wordnet?
- word practice and sentence practice
